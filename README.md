# Video Volumn Control - Firefox extension
## Simply overrides volume of any website with a simple slider

Some websites (like X / reddit) implement poor UI for controlling the video volume. 

This extension allows to control the volume using a popup in toolbar instead. 

Done in one night, should be working on most websites, but not guaranteed lol
